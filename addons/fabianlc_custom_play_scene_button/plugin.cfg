name="Custom Play Scene button"
description="Hides the \"Play Scene\" button and adds a custom button that 
sets a project setting to the scene that has to be played.

Useful for games with custom scene loading, I personally use this
to make sure playing a scene from the editor is the same as loading
it normally in the game.
